## Education
<p>
Academically, he earned a Ph.D. in Deep Learning, Computer Vision and Medical Robotics from the <a href="https://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=english">University of Strasbourg</a> France. His thesis focused on the use of deep learning for the recognition and detection of surgical tools and fine-grained activities in endoscopic videos and thereoff providing context-awareness and intraoperative decision support in the operating room. This thesis, which innovated the field of surgical action triplet detection and recognition, was supervised by <a href="http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/npadoy">Prof. Nicolas Padoy</a> (Computer Science, University of Strasbourg, France) and <a href="https://www.chru-strasbourg.fr/praticien/mutter-didier/">Prof. Didier Mutter</a> (Digestive and Endocrine Surgery, University Hospital of Strasbourg, France), examined and defended before a stellar panel of <a href="https://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavabCv">Prof. Nassir Navab</a> (Computer Scicence, TU Munich, Germany & John Hopkins University, USA), <a href="https://www.nct-dresden.de/forschung/departments-and-groups/department-for-translational-surgical-oncology.html">Prof. Stefanie Speidel</a> (Translational Surgical Oncology, NCT Dresden, Germany), and <a href="https://www.artorg.unibe.ch/research/aimi/group_members/persons/prof_dr_sznitman_raphael/index_eng.html">Prof. Raphael Snitzmann</a> (Computer Science, University of Bern, Switzerland).
</p><p>
In 2017, He was among the pioneer students of the <a href="https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/">CMMRS</a> pre-doctoral program at Saarbrucken, Germany organized by the <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornel University</a> USA, <a href="https://www.umd.edu/"> University of Maryland</a> USA and <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems</a> Germany. 
He obtained his second M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence (with Distinction) from the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/">University of Southampton</a>, United Kingdom. His Master’s thesis focus on the use of deep learning methods for the early diagnosis of skin cancers, conducted in the supervisions of <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sm3y07/">Dr. Sasan Mahmood</a> and <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Dr. Jonathan Hare</a>, and closely in consultations with <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/ifls/about/staff/mn.page">Prof. Mahesan Niranjan</a> and <a href="https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/apb1/">Prof. Adam Prugel-Bennett</a>.
</p><p>
He also obtained his B.Sc. and first M.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (with First Class Honours) from the <a href="https://www.unn.edu.ng/"> the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN)</a>. 
He is an old boy of Saint Charles Lwanga secondary school and Johnbosco primary school, Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria.
