<b>C</b>hinedu <b>I</b>nnocent <b>D</b>ominic popularly known as <b>CID</b> is an AI scientific researcher at <a href="http://icube.unistra.fr/en/">ICube laboratory</a> France, where he began in February 2018 with research focus on developing new deep learning applications in healthcare. He is also a post-doctoral research fellow at <a href="https://camma.unistra.fr/">CAMMA</a>  <a href="https://www.ihu-strasbourg.eu/institut/presentation/">IHU Strasbourg</a>, where he leads pioneering efforts in Surgical Generative AI. His research interests include Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Machine Learning and their applications in surgical assistive intervention and human-machine cooperation during surgery. His research objectives point towards the future generation intelligent operating room (OR). He is the principal organizer of the MICCAI Endoscopic Vision Biomedical Challenge on CholecTriplet, a groundbreaking initiative that models surgical activities through the lens of <i>surgical action triplet</i> - a representation of (tool-action-anatomy) relationships innovated by his PhD thesis. In addition to his research contributions, Nwoye served as an Area Chair for <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/ipcai2024/organization?authuser=0">IPCAI 2024</a> and is a co-organizer of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/lm-surg/organization?authuser=0#h.jr8rkdi4w1qf">NeurIPS workshop on Large Models Meet Surgical Data Science</a>. Currently, Dr. Nwoye also serves as an adjunct lecturer (Enseignant vacataire) at the <a href="https://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=english">University of Strasbourg</a>, where he shares his expertise and passion for advancing the field of surgical AI. His leadership and innovative research continue to push the boundaries of what is possible in medical technology.

  <summary>## Education</summary>
<p>
Academically, he earned a Ph.D. in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Medical Robotics from the <a href="https://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=english">University of Strasbourg</a> France. His thesis, which won the <a href="http://ed.math-spi.unistra.fr/doctorat/prix-de-these/">MSII doctoral thesis prize 2022</a>, focused on the use of deep learning techniques for the recognition and detection of surgical tools and fine-grained activities in endoscopic videos and thereoff providing context-awareness and intraoperative decision support in the operating room. This thesis, which innovated the field of surgical action triplet detection and recognition, was supervised by <a href="http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/npadoy">Prof. Nicolas Padoy</a> (Computer Science, University of Strasbourg, France) and <a href="https://www.chru-strasbourg.fr/praticien/mutter-didier/">Prof. Didier Mutter</a> (Digestive and Endocrine Surgery, University Hospital of Strasbourg, France), examined and defended before a stellar panel of <a href="https://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavabCv">Prof. Nassir Navab</a> (Computer Scicence, TU Munich, Germany & John Hopkins University, USA), <a href="https://www.nct-dresden.de/forschung/departments-and-groups/department-for-translational-surgical-oncology.html">Prof. Stefanie Speidel</a> (Translational Surgical Oncology, NCT Dresden, Germany), and <a href="https://www.artorg.unibe.ch/research/aimi/group_members/persons/prof_dr_sznitman_raphael/index_eng.html">Prof. Raphael Snitzmann</a> (Computer Science, University of Bern, Switzerland).

He obtained his second M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence (with Distinction) from the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/">University of Southampton</a>, United Kingdom. His Master’s thesis focused on the use of machine learning methods for the early diagnosis of skin cancers, conducted in the supervisions of <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sm3y07/">Assoc. Prof. Sasan Mahmood</a> and <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Prof. Jonathan Hare</a>, and closely in consultations with <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/ifls/about/staff/mn.page">Prof. Mahesan Niranjan</a> and <a href="https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/apb1/">Prof. Adam Prugel-Bennett</a>.
</p><p>
He also obtained his first M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (with First Class Honours) from the <a href="https://www.unn.edu.ng/"> the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN)</a>. His dissertations at UNN are both focused on the automation of different kinds of service delivery & management systems; supervised by Dr. GAM Ikekeonwu and <a href="https://www.unn.edu.ng/internals/staff/viewProfile/Nzc1">Prof. (Mrs.) Monica Agu</a>.
