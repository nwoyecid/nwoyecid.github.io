### Ongoing projects

-----

#### Activity Recognition for Tool-Tissue Interaction Understanding

> - Collate and create datasets of surgical videos labeled as triplets <instrument, verb, target> for detailed and fine-grained modeling of surgical activities.
> - Develop deep learning models based on multi-task learning, weak supervision, and attention/transformer for surgical action triplet detection.
> - Develop standard python library “ivtmetrics”- open source, now available as pip & conda python package installers for public use.

### Completed projects

##### Surgical Tool Tracking for Context-Aware Intraoperative Assistance

> - Building deep learning models for surgical instrument tracking in endoscopic videos, achieved by modeling spatial localization and temporal consistency in moving images in a video using weak supervision.
> - Resultant app now integrated in the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK demo for release.
