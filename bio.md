<b>C</b>hinedu <b>I</b>nnocent <b>D</b>ominic popularly known as <b>CID</b> is an AI scientific researcher at <a href="http://icube.unistra.fr/en/">ICube laboratory</a> France, where he began in February 2018 with research focus on developing new deep learning applications in healthcare. His research objectives point towards the future generation intelligent operating room (OR) and imbibes the methodological approaches of computer vision, machine intelligence, deep learning, and the applications thereof to surgical workflow analysis and human-machine cooperation during surgery.
He is currently with the <a href="http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/">CAMMA </a> research lab at IHU Strasbourg, France as a post-doctoral research fellow.

## Education
<p>
Academically, he earned a Ph.D. in Computer Vision, Deep Learning, and Medical Robotics from the <a href="https://www.unistra.fr/index.php?id=english">University of Strasbourg</a> France. His thesis, which won the <a href="http://ed.math-spi.unistra.fr/doctorat/prix-de-these/">MSII doctoral thesis prize 2022</a>, focused on the use of deep learning techniques for the recognition and detection of surgical tools and fine-grained activities in endoscopic videos and thereoff providing context-awareness and intraoperative decision support in the operating room. This thesis, which innovated the field of surgical action triplet detection and recognition, was supervised by <a href="http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/npadoy">Prof. Nicolas Padoy</a> (Computer Science, University of Strasbourg, France) and <a href="https://www.chru-strasbourg.fr/praticien/mutter-didier/">Prof. Didier Mutter</a> (Digestive and Endocrine Surgery, University Hospital of Strasbourg, France), examined and defended before a stellar panel of <a href="https://campar.in.tum.de/Main/NassirNavabCv">Prof. Nassir Navab</a> (Computer Scicence, TU Munich, Germany & John Hopkins University, USA), <a href="https://www.nct-dresden.de/forschung/departments-and-groups/department-for-translational-surgical-oncology.html">Prof. Stefanie Speidel</a> (Translational Surgical Oncology, NCT Dresden, Germany), and <a href="https://www.artorg.unibe.ch/research/aimi/group_members/persons/prof_dr_sznitman_raphael/index_eng.html">Prof. Raphael Snitzmann</a> (Computer Science, University of Bern, Switzerland).
</p><p>
In 2017, He was among the pioneer students of the <a href="https://cmmrs.mpi-sws.org/">CMMRS</a> pre-doctoral program at Saarbrucken, Germany organized by the <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornel University</a> USA, <a href="https://www.umd.edu/"> University of Maryland</a> USA and <a href="https://www.mpi-sws.org/">Max-Planck Institute for Software Systems</a> Germany. 
He obtained his second M.Sc. degree in Artificial Intelligence (with Distinction) from the <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/">University of Southampton</a>, United Kingdom. His Master’s thesis focused on the use of machine learning methods for the early diagnosis of skin cancers, conducted in the supervisions of <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/~sm3y07/">Assoc. Prof. Sasan Mahmood</a> and <a href="https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/jsh2">Prof. Jonathan Hare</a>, and closely in consultations with <a href="https://www.southampton.ac.uk/ifls/about/staff/mn.page">Prof. Mahesan Niranjan</a> and <a href="https://cmg.soton.ac.uk/people/apb1/">Prof. Adam Prugel-Bennett</a>.
</p><p>
He also obtained his first M.Sc. and B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science (with First Class Honours) from the <a href="https://www.unn.edu.ng/"> the University of Nigeria, Nsukka (UNN)</a>. His dissertations at UNN are both focused on the automation of different kinds of service delivery & management systems; supervised by Dr. GAM Ikekeonwu and <a href="https://www.unn.edu.ng/internals/staff/viewProfile/Nzc1">Prof. (Mrs.) Monica Agu</a>.
He is an old boy of Saint Charles Lwanga secondary school and Johnbosco primary school, Onitsha, Anambra State, Nigeria.

## Career
<p>
In 2022, He started a post-doctoral research at CAMMA: <a href="http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/">Computational Analysis and Modeling of Medical Activities </a> research group headed by his supervisor <a href="http://camma.u-strasbg.fr/npadoy">Prof. Nicolas Padoy</a>, in a close collaborations with the <a href="https://www.ihu-strasbourg.eu/institut/presentation/">IHU MixSurg institute</a>, the <a href="http://www.ircad.fr/?lng=en">IRCAD institute</a> and the <a href="#">Strasbourg University Hospitals</a> for medical data and other supports. He also belongs to wider research groups, <a href="https://rdh.icube.unistra.fr">RDH (Robotics, Data science and Healthcare technologies)</a> and <a href="http://icube-web.unistra.fr/dsai/index.php/Main_Page">Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (DSAI)</a> in the ICube institute.
Part of his job include teaching and supervision at the Univeristy of Strasbourg, France.
</p><p>
He is also a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.unn.edu.ng/">UNN</a> in the department of computer science, where he began as a graduate teaching assistant in 2014.  He was a Google ambassador between 2010 – 2012 and founded the <a href="#">Software Developers Club (SDC)</a> and <a href="https://cidsoft.com">CIDSoft</a> in Nigeria.
