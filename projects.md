### Ongoing projects

-----

#### Activity recognition for tool-tissue interaction understanding

> - Collate and create datasets of surgical videos labeled as triplets <instrument, verb, target> for detailed and fine-grained modeling of surgical activities.
> - Develop deep learning models based on multi-task learning, weak supervision, and attention/transformer for surgical action triplet detection.
> - Develop standard python library “ivtmetrics”- open source, now available as pip & conda python package installers for public use.

#### Surgical tool tracking for context-aware intraoperative assistance

> - Building deep learning models for surgical instrument tracking in endoscopic videos, achieved by modeling spatial localization and temporal consistency in moving images in a video using weak supervision.
> - Resultant app now integrated in the NVIDIA Holoscan SDK demo for release.
